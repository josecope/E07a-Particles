# E07a-Particles
Hello!

In this assignment, I worked with particle effects and make them look like fire and smoke/embers.

THe first step in doing this was changing the background color to a very light pink.  I did this so that the dark grays from the smoke could be seen since they were practically invisible against the black background.

Next, I tried out different particles, and eventually settled on one of the star assets.  To make them look like fire, I swtiched the colors to different hues of red, orange, and yellow, and then made certain parts bigger and smaller.

Thanks for checking it out!
